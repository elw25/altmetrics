This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
 
 Here we include stuff in chunks. Here, it will run R and display outputs. 
 
 We can add chunks through clicky, control option i, or something else. 
 
 
 
 ```{r}
 dim(cars)

```

how fun is that!

I can look at the R Markdown tab and see what R is actually doing

default will show code as written. I don't always want to do that. If I do echo=false, R won't include everything in the report  

Sometimes we want to show code but not output. That is results="hide"

What is the numer of cars**?
```{r, include=FALSE}
dim(cars) [1]

```
